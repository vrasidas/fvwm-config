Programs embeded in FvwmButtons:

pclock, wmclock, wmweather, wmbiff, xload, wmcpu, wmforkplop, wmnd, wmhdplop
stalonetray and a conky.

I include the bare minimum icons to have the buttonbar and menus working, most
come from gnome-colors, some I made myself with pixmap or copy-pasted them
to existence in the gimp.

The gtk theme is a slightly darker version of Evolve.

The config was originally taken from the FVWM starter's kit two years ago.
I have been butchering it ever since.
